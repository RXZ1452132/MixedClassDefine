This repo defines a unified representation for all classification/segmentation datasets in the context of autonomous
driving vehicles, which combine different datasets into a general framework.


Q1:
For example: lane markings are divided by (white/yellow) and (single/double), and then creat one kind of lane marking double white lane, which never exist in real life. When you write a new map_file using '.../white' or '.../white single;  .../white, double' both are OK.
